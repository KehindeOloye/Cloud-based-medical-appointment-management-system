			a patient can see all scheduled appointments. This includes all past and future ones. A patient (with his/her name entered already)
			 can make an appointment. A date and time-slot must be specified. A patient can optionally specify a GP. If unspecified, the system will 
			randomly assign an available GP in the requested time-slot.The patient can select an appointment from the list and delete it. By selecting an
